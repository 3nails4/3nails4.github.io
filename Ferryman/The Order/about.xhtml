            <center>
            <p>For In The Begining Rome / Egypt / Greek Were To High For The Common MAN </p>
            <p>There Was A Fusion In Mythology's = Some Hidden For MAN Was Not Ready To Perceive Their Greatness At Certain Points On The Globe Or In Time</p>
            <br/>
            <p>So WE Will Keep The Lesson Breif To Show You A Frame Work Of UnderStanding</p>
            <p>For Science = The Story Holds The Scientific Principle With Out Revealing The Formula For The Story Is The Proccess To The Mathematical Formula = Raising A Child = Tip Not Every One Can Go Straight To The Answer = Their World Frame Work Breaks And Few Can Reconfigure = Thinking Outside The Box </p>
            <p>For The Sake Of The Lesson / Play WE Shall Put Each Mythology In A Place = Parts Hidden / Parts Shown To Relay 1 Of Many Formulas</p>
            <p>So Shall A Begin This Small Tale</p>
            <p>For Rome And Egypt Were Cosmic In A Scientific Sense / Ratio = Myth / Science = 1/2 = 1/4</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Greek Was For The Love Of The Story = 2/1 = 4/1</p>
            <p>For The Love Of The Story Is For The Common MAN</p>
            <p>For The Formula Was For The Curious Cat (Look How They Look) / Curious Mind</p>
            <p>For Advanced Science Is Used To Understand The Roman Plants/Mythology</p>
            <p>For Advanced Science Is Used To Understand The Eygption Planetary / Cosmic Memory Vault</p>
            <p>For Advanced Science Is Used TO Understand The Greek Proccess Of The Mind For Story To Science</p>
            
            <p>The Danger Of This Tale Is That The Advance Language Of The Eygption Works, In The Longivity Of The Tale</p>
            <p>For You Do Not Need A Tongue To Relay The Story</p>
            <p>The Less WE Go Into The Matter The Better For The EGO Of MAN Is Fragile</p>
            
            <p>Now Know Man That There Is More Magic Or Wonder To This Cosmos Than You Know / For All Is Know Yet Not Know To You</p>
